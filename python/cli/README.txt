Pinscher is a collection of software that manages password collections. Pinscher helps you store and retrieve passwords for as many accounts as you like. It can also create random (complex) passwords for you so you can easily have a different password for each account you own.

Your username and password details are stored in strongly encrypted files so you don't have to worry about them being stolen. These encrypted files can be kept on cloud services like Dropbox_ or `Google Drive`_. This way you can share passwords across all of your computers and devices.
